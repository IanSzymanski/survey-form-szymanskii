FreeCodeCamp Certification project form, a form about apples.

Woo this was a tough one, but I had a lot of fun doing this. I'm sure that some of the solutions that I thought were smart were jank, and some of the solutions that I thought were jank were smart, but if it works it works.
Really proud of how far I have come in just a short while. There were somethings that I wish I could have done, like styling the dropdown of the select element, but you really are quite limited when constrained to CSS. I also could not find a solution to
give adequate padding to the user's text inputs into textboxes without also changing the preview text.
